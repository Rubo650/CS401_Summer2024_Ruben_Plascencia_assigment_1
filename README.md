- Welcome to my source code for the simple calculator. 
- This calculator houses simple functions such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
- It allows the user to input 2 numbers and then select an operation that corresponds to the number assigned to it(example: 1 is Addition, 2 is Subtraction, etc). 
- The program allows you to reloop and do a new operation with different numbers.

Steps:
1. Pick 2 whole numbers(that can preferably divide from each other evenly)
2. Pick an arithmic operation with its corresponding number
3. Type "yes"/"Yes" if you wish to do another operation or "no"/"No" if you wish to stop the program
